				Hi Trevor,<br/>
				I would like a little more information about your impersonation services. What exactly do you do at events and what would it cost?<br/>
				Best,<br/>
				Robin
			</div>
			<div class="emailresponse">
				Hi Robin!<br/>
				Well, that depends on what the event is and where it is. I charge for travel expenses (I don't have access to Air Force One, remember?), and that's usually it.<br/>
				As far as what I do at events, well, once I show up and people start thinking I'm Barack, I don't need to do much, except point out to your confused guests that I'm not him. That keeps people pretty well entertained for several hours

				Hey, just wanted to say thanks for health care reform and stuff.  It gives me peace of mind to know that an insurance company can't deny me health insurance due to a preexisting condition. Keep up the good work.
			</div>
			<div class="emailresponse">
				You're welcome. I worked so hard on that bill and I'm happy to see it pass.<br/>

				...That was good, wasn't it? Just like Barack.
